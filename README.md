# DSA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-3
My DSA Project On Power BI
## Project Topic: Palmora Group HR Analysis
### Project Overview
This project was about Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, which was embroiled in issues 
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. I was able to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management 
team would need to address, and the report was visualised using appropriate charts. The primary focus of this analysis was on gender-related issues within the organization and its 
regions. The insights used were based on my discretion.
