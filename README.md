# DSA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-3
My DSA Project On Power BI

## Project Topic: Palmora Group HR Analysis
### Project Overview
This project was about Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, which was embroiled in issues 
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. I was able to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management 
team would need to address, and the report was visualised using appropriate charts. The primary focus of this analysis was on gender-related issues within the organization and its 
regions. The insights used were based on my discretion.
### Data Source
The data source for this pjroject was shared with all registered student of DSA by **The Incubator Hub** of which i'm one. The data was contained in two files; one excel file and another csv file.
### Tools Used
Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/excel)

Microsoft Power BI [Douwnload Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
- For data transformation
- For exploration and analysis
- For data visualisation
### Analytical Approach
- Understanding of Business Problem and Given Data
- Data Importation
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Data Exploration and Analysis
- Data Visualisation
#### Uderstanding of Business Problem  
Before commencing the analysis, I took time to properly and fully understand what the business problem is all about and what i'm expected to do as an HR analyst. This is very pivotal to my analysis because it helps me to know where i'm going to and how to help the business achieve their aim.

#### Uderstanding the Given Data
The next thing to do after understanding the business problem which I did before analysis is to take a close study of the given data. I took time to study and understand the given data which help me know how to clean, explore and visualise the data properly.

#### Data Importation

Importing my data as a csv file and excel file from my file manager into the Power BI was an easy one as we have been taught by [Teedee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/temidayoayeni/) This is also to tell you that Power BI can allow the importation of data from various sources which includes:
  - Excel
  - SQL
  - Text/CSV
  - Online servers e.t.c

#### Data Cleaning and Transformation
In this stage, I was able to take my data to the mechanic workshop like my boss would say. I did a number of work on the data which includes.
 - Removal of rows without salary
 - Removal of rows with unindicated departments
 - Assigning generic gender status to employee without gender

Yet in the mechanic workshop, I transformed the data doing the following;
 - Creation of column for salary band using conditional column
 - Unpivoting of the bonus mapping data using unpivot button in the **Any Column** library of the **TRANSFORM** tab
 - Merging of the bonus data with the first data as a new table 
 - Allocation of bonus for each employee base on their departments and rating
 - Calculation of the total salary expected for each employee

#### Data Exploration and Analysis
Under this step I was able to put answers to the following questions using charts and graphs:

  1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments

  2. Show insights on ratings based on gender

  3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

  4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000. Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
     
  6. Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. Also visualize this by regions
     
  8. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed another data to you that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to
   - calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual employees
   - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
   - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

#### Data Visualisation
using the visualization pane, I was able to produce a visual representation of my analysis which displayed the exploratory information needed.

### Results and Insight
My analysis shows that there is a gender pay gap in departments like:
 - Production Management
 - Legal
 - Support
 - Accounting

All the departments stated here shew a pay gaps of male employees receiving in total almost $100,000 more than the female employees which is not suppose to be so because in terms of rating female employees have shown to have good rating than the male employees.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on my analysis, I  will advise **PALMORA GROUP** to employ more females than males now all their regions due to the fact that analysis shows all that region to contain more male employee than female employee.
